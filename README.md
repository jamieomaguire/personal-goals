Personal Goals
==============

Open sourcing my personal development as a software engineer. I'd like this to help keep me more organised, accountable and engaged!

# Big Picture Goals for 2022
1. 📚 Read at least 6 books relevant to my field (titles TBD)
2. 🤖 Expand my JS framework knowledge to include React
3. 🧙 Become a JS performance wizard
4. 🎨 Become a CSS savant
5. 💜 Make accessibility my middle name
6. 🛠️ Create, release and maintain some software for public usage
7. 🕹️ Make some open source contributions


# Specific skills I'd like to build on

## JS
- React (and associated technologies i.e. state management)
- Typescript
- GraphQL
- Building open-source component libraries (any framework but probably React or Vue) published to NPM
- Advanced Storybook usage
- Node (perhaps using Express or similar libraries for APIs/light backend work)
- JS-based browser testing frameworks such as Cypress (or alternative)
- Cross-platform frameworks (likely React Native)
